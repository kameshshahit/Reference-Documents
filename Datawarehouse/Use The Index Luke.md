## Performance and Scalability
>### Performance Impacts of Data Volume
>### Performance Impacts of System Load
>### Response Time, Throughput and Horizontal Scalability
>**Note:**
> - Performance has two dimensions: response time and throughput.
> - More hardware will typically not improve query response time.
> - Proper indexing is the best way to improve query response time.
